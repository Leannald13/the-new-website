# My very first webpage

The purpose of this project was to develop the basic skills of using HTML and CSS.
It has developed skills in areas such as:

Importing images
Creating links and href
Developing the basic understanding of margins, padding, font styles and sizes etc

I then used this project to use git and github for the first time which I understand is vital as a developer.
